# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems on LeetCode. It's a collection of coding challenges that I have solved in order to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. Each folder corresponds to a specific problem, and contains the code solution along with any explanations or comments.

## Purpose

- **Preparation for interviews:**  A way to review and improve my coding skills for upcoming technical interviews.
- **Personal growth:** To strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- **Showcasing my skills:** This repository serves as a portfolio to demonstrate my problem-solving abilities to potential employers.

## Structure

- Each LeetCode problem is organized in its own folder named according to the problem's title.
- The folder contains:
    - A task description provided in comments at the top of the main.cpp file.
    - The code solution.
    - A time and space complexity analysis (sometimes included).
    - An explanation of the approach used to solve the problem (sometimes included).
