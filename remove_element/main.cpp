// TASK
// Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place.
// The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

// Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

// Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. 
// The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
// Return k.

// SOLUTION

class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        for (auto it = nums.begin(); it < nums.end();) {
            if (*it == val) {
                it = nums.erase(it);
            } else {
                it++;
            }
        } 
        return nums.size();
    }
